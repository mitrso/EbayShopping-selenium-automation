Problem 1:
I have tried to create a sample framework for the task that was given to automate. There can 
be multiple enhancement made in the framework like adding screenshot, a proper result and adding 
Log4j for logging. However with the time that i had juggling with my deliverables I could just 
complete this. There can be many more asserts based on the tests that was given but i have just 
just used few of them.

Explanation of the framework:
FrameworkPackages folder contains all the framework related classess
Pages contains all the page related methods
AddtoCart class is the TestNg class where you the flow of the test.
properties file is the place from where we are getting the user inputs
pom.xml contains all the dependency required for the project.


Problem 2:
Go To Checkout or Continue To sign can only be done if we get more details as there are number of 
fields which needs to be filled. There are lot of unknown so that was not automated but it should
be pretty easy to automate when the info is available

Now, coming to logging in with previous registered user, we need a database or an excel at the least
to store the data that we have used for previous log in.Because if the session ends the value might
not be retained and we would need a storage to get around that.

Problem 3:
Pythagorean triplet class is available in Pages package. It has a main method and please run it as
java application.
